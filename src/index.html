    ** Instead of using the cdn above for the bursary upload form
    ** I built a suitable ckeditor at: https://ckeditor.com/cke4/builder
    ** then added it to assets and referenced it as below
    ** so i did this because with the cdn i was getting a bug 'editor-destroy-iframe'
    ** it needed the 'divarea' plugin which the cdn basic ckeditor did not have
    ** so I configured the ckeditor and added the 'divarea' plugin
